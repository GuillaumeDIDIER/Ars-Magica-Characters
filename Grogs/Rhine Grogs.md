**Story:**  
He was born in the city of Erfurt, the third son of a family of Woad merchants. While a gregarious child he never showed the shrewdness necessary to succeed in business compared to his older brothers. The child was always devout and loved to stay in the shadows of Saint Maria's cathedral while his father would conduct business in the nearby area. Realising that the boy would be serve as a devout, he was entrusted to the seminary to turn him into a priest along with a donation equal to his share of his inheritance.  
At the age of 22 he took his vows as brother chaplain of the Teutonic order, wishing to go spread the faith and support the faithful.
Disappointingly, he was not sent to the Holy Lands as he had hoped, but sent to Prussia* to support his brothers crusading.
Taking as priestly name Paulus, he seeks to follow in the footsteps of the apostle Paul. While he abstains from carnal knowledge, he is tormented by his gluttony (which he feels guilty for). He never learned to ride and finds even the lightest of excursions exhausting due to his massive girth.
He remains a jolly character easy to get along with and seeking to foster good relations with those he meets. He is a passable churchman, who without excelling, always showed goodwill in his studies.

Note: The Teutonic order only got involved in the Prussian Crusade from 1226 onwards. To use the character in a game starting in 1220, replace Prussia with Romania (including as area lore and languages).

**Appearance:**  
Of average height, he has a massive paunch. He has the tonsure (that marks him as a clergyman) burned into his short light brown hair. He remains clean shaven as much as possible and wears a green cape marked with the black cross of his order in all occasions. He wears woad dyed clothes when not performing his priestly duty, as it reminds him of his family back in Erfurt.

**Why is he in the covenant?**  
If the covenant is in the Prussian region (or Transylvania), he might have been sent there to tend to the religious needs of the covenant as part of the Teutonic Order's push east.  
If he enjoys good relations with the Teutonic Order, he might have been sent to the covenant as a spy, or to keep tabs on them. He might have befriended German Grogs of the covenant and received a derogation to go live amongst them to keep them in the right path.

He might also have become frustrated or outraged by the violence used by his order, at which point he might have simply left the Order and gone on to find himself a curate elsewhere, with a Hermetic Covenant offering him a safe asylum. (This could bring angry Teutonic knights knocking at the door at some point.)

**Story:**  
The first son of a winemaker, we was trained to take over from his father, however rumour has it that he knifed a neighbour over an off colour comment over his sister. Rather than face justice, he left his hometown of Ingelheim, never to return. He has travelled extensively in the South of Germany and worked when he could as labourer for winemakers in the Mosel and Franken region. Unfortunately his temper gets the better of him and forces him to move on. He has learned to live off the land as much as he can.

Note: This works for any wine maker, this could easily be switched to different regions, such as Toscany, Burgundy, Bordeaux... As is ,he is eminently suited for a Rhine Gorge Covenant since he is more or less local.

**Appearance:**  
A tall looking farmer, still in his youth. His hair is all the blonder than it is sunbleached, his skin is tanned from his long hours spent walking or working in the sun. His hands are calloused by the years labour. He already looks weathered by his extensive travels. He is poorly dressed with his clothes damaged by bad mending. His great solace is wine, in which he takes pleasure and is at his most friendly. Until something sets him off, then the fists are flying.

**Why is he in the covenant?**  
Golo the winemaker is a wander, his cannot go back home, nor to any of his previous employers. While he is a passable winemaker, he can survive off the land when need be.
He can be the winemaker for a covenant with a vineyard, but will also be able to assist in many outdoors activities.  
Of course his anger issues will probably put him at odds with other grogs, or require the Covenant to get him out of trouble when he starts a fight with nearby villagers.

### Abilities:

+ Area Lore: Speyer 2 (jews)
+ Artes Liberales 3 (mathematics) 3
+ Awareness 2 (alertness)
+ Concentration 3 (ceremonies)
+ Etiquette 1 (religious figures)
+ Folk Ken 2 (jews)
+ Hebrew 4 (religious usage)
+ Language (Native): High German 5 (yiddish)
+ Language: Ancient Greek 3 (academic)
+ Language: Latin 4 (academic)
+ Judaic Lore 3 (folklore)
+ Profession: Scribe 4 (copying)
+ Theology: Judaism 4 (torah)

**Story:**  
The only daughter of the Rabbi of Speyer, she grew up surrounded by books. her father always doted on her and noticing her interest in books and learning always catered to her learning. Knowing that she could never attend Rabbinic school as she would have wanted, he took it upon himself to teach her all that he could and giving her full access to all his books. He wanted to take her as Sofer but the community rebelled against such an untraditional choice. As the Rabbi ages, he realises that she must either marry (which she has shown little interest for) or at least leave to go and find herself a new home. Through an acquaintance, a secret Kabbalist, she was entrusted to the Order of Hermes with the promise that she would be well treated and allowed to continue her learning in her new home (a Covenant). Spoiled by her father's attention, growing up with little contact with other children and well aware that she is more intelligent and better educated than almost everyone she ever interacted with, she has become somewhat difficult to get along with, barely suppressing her pride.

Note: I picked Speyer due to its historical Jewish community, just changing her default language from German to literally anything else will make her local. On the other hand, since she has the flaw outsider, she will be an outsider in any community.

**Appearance:**  
Olive skinned and slightly built, she partially covers her long curly jet black hair with colourful shawls. Her fingers are often inkstained after copying manuscripts. She wears loose robes with space for quills and scrolls up her sleeves. She makes little effort on her personal appearance, often preferring to pull her hood up to hide her features, lest they give her away and lead to insults.

**Why is he in the covenant?**  
Devorah is a woman in the wrong century, she is an academic at heart with no interest in household activities instead preferring to cultivate herself. As a Jew she knows she faces persecution outside of her community and simply does not want to run that risk.  
She will be very useful to any Covenant as a latin scribe, and if she learns to teach as she grows older could be a good teacher for young (potential) apprentices.  
*Obviously a masculine version of Devorah would work, but he would have less reason to join a Covenant since he would not face the same hurdles...*

## Adalbert, the smith

+ Carouse 3 (beer)

+ Faerie Lore 4 (dwarves)
+ Folk Ken 4 (cityfolk)
+ Language (Native): Low German 5 (westphalian)
+ Smiths Guild Lore 3 (famous members)
+ Teaching 1 (apprentices)

**Story:**  
Adalbert is descended from Alberich, yes that one. From the Nibelungenlied. His kids were exiled to the world of men, and settled in the hilly Sauerland area, north East of Cologne. It's not easy living, since the miners do have to sometimes fight the goblins from down under. But this breeds hard folk.  
Adalbert is the latest in a long line of smiths, tracing their lineage to the first records, if they are to be believed. The veracity of that is debatable, the quality of his wares ais not. Adalbert makes the finest steel swords, and his axes can split a tree in hardly a blow.  
Adalbert is envious of others, for they do not face mockery over their size and receive too much praise for their unremarkable work. He worries about getting cheated in any bargain he enters and is generally distrustful. He is a member of the smith's guild and keeps informed of his peers' works, as well as having trained a couple of apprentices already.  
He is not afraid of a fight, swinging smithing tools as weapons at anyone he thinks might be a thief. Or his fists at anyone who'd mess with his beer.

**Appearance:**  
A little under four-and-a-half feet tall, but barrel chested with arms knotted with muscles, Adalbert is a stout man. He braids his beard in two which he tucks into his leather apron. The man is charcoal stayed and his hands and forearms are covered in healed small burns. He has hard eyes and looks suspiciously at all who visit his smithy.

**Why is he in the covenant?**  
Adalbert is not only an exceptional smith but also is interested in the secrets of the runes and old dwarven crafts. He might have joined the Covenant out of friendship with a Veriditius or Merinita mage, or maybe to collaborate with a Bonisagius. He might live within the Covenant itself having access to magic implements to supplement his craft or have his smithy in a nearby village with regular contacts with the Covenant. Maybe he is married to a Covenant member (Custos? Companion?) who same past his physique and moved to follow them.
*Adalbert could just as easily be a she-dwarf, maybe replacing the teaching (apprentice) and the guild lore with two other skills, since she would not have been allowed into the smiths' guild, but giving her a better reason to join a Covenant than being a standard guild member.*

## Brauerin Käthchen

**Characteristics:** Int +0, Per +1, Pre +2, Com +2, Str +0, Sta +1, Dex +0, Qik -1  
**Size:** 0  
**Age:** 20

### Abilities:

+ Area Lore: Upper Bavaria 2 (gossip)
+ Athletics 1 (running)
+ Awareness 2 (searching)
+ Bargain 4 (haggling)
+ Charm 2 (men)
+ Craft: Beer 5 (weizen)
+ Folk Ken 4 (cityfolk)
+ Language (native): High German 5 (bavarian)
+ Intrigue 3 (gossip)
+ Music 2 (singing)

**Story:**  
Käthchen hails from Eichstätt, in Upper Bavaria. The daughter of a brewer she learned his craft in the hope of becoming a brewer, finding a good husband and running an inn or at least a Biergarten of her own.  
However she is an uncontrollable gossip, who feels the need to immerse herself in everybody else's business and is unable to keep to herself what her intuition (which is often right) reveals to her.  
She makes excellent Weizenbier but has been experimenting with other styles with less success.

**Appearance:**  
Blond braids, a bright green dirndl and freckles, Käthchen is a very pleasant looking girl. She is a little slow but makes up for it with the tireless effort she is used to putting into her brewing. She is highly communicative and puts her conversation partners at ease, before bombarding them with questions but feeding them tasty morsels of gossip in exchange.

**Why is he in the covenant?**  
Käthchen is a terrible gossip and meddler, she let loose too many secrets in her small hometown and ended up being bundled away. Why would she bring up the Bishop's mistress so often, surely she should know better than that?  
The bishop decreed that such a wagging tong must be witchcraft and had her sent to her fellow witches in the woods. Of course, a Bavarian Covenant has no lack of talented brewers but were happy to pass her on to fellow magi, for just a small compensation and maybe a bit of wine...  
In addition to making beer (a valuable commodity) she has good social skills and could be used by the Covenant as a go between when dealing mundanes.

+ Language: Low German 3 (slang)
+ Legerdemain 2 (filtching)
+ Music 2 (singing)
+ Survival 2 (forests)
+ Thrown Weapon 2 (javelin)

**Story:**  
These two were captured by the Livonian Sword brothers in Samogitia to be fed into the slave trade. They have deliberately remained unbaptised as the interdiction on slavery applies only to Christian slaves. The Knights came by boat, raided the village, killing the adults who resisted and captured those healthy enough to be sold on. After being shipped to Riga, then further down the coast, they were purchased in Prague by someone who saw potential in them.  
Both are fearful of horses as their first experience of them was receiving a cavalry charge.

**Appearance:**  
Hailing from a land roamed by giants, the twins stand out from the other slaves on the market, both of them over six feet tall, looking dirty but healthy and with a defiant to surly look in their eyes. They observe keenly all around them and move with undeniable grace, looking far nimbler than the usual peasant stock. Both carry a slave brand on their neck.  
They sing to each other when they feel unobserved.

**Why is he in the covenant?**  
Probably bought at a slave market by a member of the Order who saw potential in them. They are big, tireless and very suitable to join the Turb once they get a bit of military training (buying the warrior virtue and a year of training would give them Thrown 5).  
They are young enough to be apprenticed if one has the gift, making for an unusual apprentice.  
Alternatively, they could be used as basis for the Covenant's turb if one were to assume a bulk purchase, with a dozen of them needing to be only a little to form a coherent band of shield grogs.
