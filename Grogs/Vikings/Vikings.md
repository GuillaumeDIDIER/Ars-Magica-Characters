This is a band of 25 time shifted Vikings

As such they all have the **Worthless Ability** Flaw, with 30 lost experience points on a pair of Area Lore (15 each)

This band of viking are designed as having vanished around 900 in the Volga, they still believe Prince Oleg (a viking / varangian) rules upon the Kiev Rus', and that Sarkel is a flourishing city on the Volga.

This flaw grants us one virtue slot which is **Warrior** for all of them.

Different flaws may need to be substituted for a different setting.

This folder also contains a bunch of images, Tokens (rolladvantage token stamp generator)
and images that can be used to generate tokens.

All vikings use an armor at +6 Prot / +3 Load

They also use a shield (+3 defense), for applicable weapon they have Def with Shield (Def with no shield) in the stats.

They are generally Encumbered by 1 whicg reduces their Quikness outside combat (and for initiative)

# Ship
The viking is the crew of a Karvi (or Karve), the smallest kind of ship that can be used for military purposes.

It could fit up to 5 more crewmembers. It is suitable for river navigation (and being carried on portages)

# Crew organisation
The crew captain (skirl) is Harald Eiriksson, 28.

He is seconded by Svein Ulfsson, his first mate (27).

Other senior crew members are Carl Kalfsson, 25, the cook, and Thora Audsdottir, 27, a might female warrior who dislikes most womanly things.
She acts as the Surgeon of the team. (But her ministration tend to be a bit rough but efficient)

The youngest crew member is Olaf Grimsson, 18.

A well known trio is Bjorn, Egil and Halfgrim, whose friendship is proverbial.
Wherever one of them can be found, the other two are usully very close behind.

The remainder of the crew are more generic vikings of age 23-24

Those vikings fight in combat split into 6 trained combat group.

Harald leads the first group, of 5, with Bjorn as its vanguard and Egil, Halfgrim and Olaf as members.

Svein leads the second group, of 4, Carl the Third and Thora the Fourth.

The Fifth group is made up of those 4 vikings who known how to use a bow (those are also swords men).

The Sixth group is composed of 4 Vikings who can aim with a sling, and use an axe otherwise.

- (2): The Viking Axe is a bit more dangerous as it is designed for war.
- (3): Mismatch between core and LoM, using core Atk+2, vs LoM Def+2
- (4): This is a slightly more dangerous dagger. The Seax or Saxe knife is a tool and a weapon
- (5): Larger than normal round shield, protects well but is bulky
- (6): This a cook specialty

# Individuals and Archetypes

## Harald Eiriksson

An inspiring leader, but craving travel and quite reckless. He fights with a fearsome axe and strives to provide riches and adventure to his crew. In this his recklessness is tampered by his first mate Svein.
He is a bit more intelligent that the usual blood thirst viking and he is one of the very few who reads, writes and counts.

He leads the First combat group, with Bjorn as his Vanguard, fighting along with Egil, Halfgrim and Olaf. This group is a most fearsome and powerful combat unit.

## Thora Audsdottir

The only women on board, but she'll punch you if you ever treat her differently. She fiercly rejects the gender role that society
would assign her. She is quite strong willed and hard to manipulate. She's not great with her words, but her presence is unmistakingly imposing and impressive.
She fights with a her well honed vking axe, "swords are for pussies" (SIC). Viking warriors being inept at chirurgy, and considering it a womanly thing and the sole concession
she ever made to her gender was taking on the responsability of surgeon of the crew. She's well respected by the crew and treated no differently than any other warrior.
Her ministration are know for being a bit brutal and often a bit painful (or more).

She leads the fourth group whose vanguard is an agile swords man, and that collectively is a very reactive unit.

## Carl Kalfsson


The cook of the crew, he is a busybody that cannot help but attempt to uncover
every piece of gossip that concerns crewmen. He has surprising reserves of strength.

He fights with a Sword but has no issue throwing axes or knocking people with
his most fearsome wooden laddle !

He is prone to unfortunate flashbacks however.

Rely on neither his memory (poor) nor his sense of direction (inexsistant), fortunately his best friends and mates Egil and Halfgrim care after him !

# Further ressources

## List of Virtues
+ **Clear Thinker** *(general, minor)*
You think logically and rationally. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to resist lies, confusion,
befuddlement, and subterfuge — whether magical or mundane.

+ **Improved Characteristics** *(general, minor)*
You  have  an  additional  three  points  to spend on buying Characteristics, but you are still limited to a maximum 
score of +3 in any single Characteristic unless you take the Virtue Great Characteristic. You may take this Virtue 
multiple times.

+ **Inspirational** *(general, minor)**
You are a stirring speaker or a heroic figure, and can urge people to great efforts.
You give targets a +3 bonus to rolls for appropriate Personality Traits.


+ **Perfect Balance** *(general, minor)*
You are skilled at keeping your balance, especially on narrow ledges or tightropes. Add +6 to any roll to avoid falling or tripping.

+ **Piercing Gaze** *(general, minor)*
By staring intently at people you make them feel uneasy, as if you are peering into their souls.
Those with ulterior motives, uneasy consciences, or lying tongues must make rolls against an appropriate
Personality Trait, Guile, or whatever the storyguide deems appropriate, to remain calm. Furthermore,
you gain a +3 to rolls involving intimidation. Faeries and demons are unfazed by your power.

+ **Puissant _Ability_ ** *(general, minor)*
You are particularly adept with one Ability, and add 2 to its value whenever you use it. Note that you do not,
in general, use an Ability when learning it, teaching it, or writing about it. You may only take this Virtue once
for a given Ability, but may take it more than once for different Abilities.

+ **Rapid Convalescence** *(general, minor)*
Your body can heal quickly. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to recover from wounds.

+ **Reserves of Strength** *(general, minor)*
Once per day, when in need, you can perform an incredible feat of strength. For the duration of the action,
add +3 to your effective Strength score. Afterwards, though, you must make two Fatigue rolls.

+ **Strong-Willed** *(general, minor)*
You cannot easily be coerced into activities, beliefs, or feelings. You get +3 on any roll which may require strength of will.

- **Tough** *(general, minor)*
You can take physical punishment better than most people. You get a +3 bonus on your Soak score.

+ **Warrior** *(general, minor)*
You  have  been  trained  to  fight,  and  may have spent some time campaigning, perhaps on one 
of  the  Crusades.  You  may  acquire  Martial Abilities during character creation, and gain an 
additional 50 experience points which must be spent on Martial Abilities.


## List of Flaws

+ **Ability Block** *(general, minor)*
You are completely unable to learn a certain class of Abilities, for some reason.
This may be Martial Abilities, or a more limited set of the others. A profound inability
to master logic would rule out Artes Liberales, Philosophiae, any Law, Medicine, and Theology.
Alternatively, you might be unable to learn any languages other than your native tongue.
It must be possible for your character to learn the abilities in question, but she need have
no intention of doing so. You may only take this Flaw once.

+ **Busybody** *(personality, minor)**
You usually know everything that is going on among your friends and acquaintances,
especially in private matters. You are always interested in rumors and gossip, and are
frequently able to extract personal secrets from people. Among magi the language is more
dignified, but the idea is the same: you keep tabs on the Hermetic community
(your covenant, your House, and nearby covenants — at the least). However, magi probably
don’t have much knowledge of what’s going on among the lower class members of
their covenant unless they choose to apply this Flaw specifically to such people at
character creation.

+ **Carefree** *(personality, minor)*
You are unshakably cheerful and happy in all circumstances.

+ **Craving for Travel** *(general, minor)*
The character suffers from feelings of loneliness, boredom, and depression if he does not expose himself to new experiences.
He can stave off the boredom for a while, but if he remain in one place for more than a season, he suffers a –1 penalty to
all rolls and totals until he experiences a change in scene. This penalty rises to –3 af- ter a year of boredom.
This character is probably the first to volunteer for a mission beyond the covenant gates, and may even spend part of each
year in a different location such as the nearby wood. This Flaw might seem to make the character unsuitable for life at a covenant,
so you should decide what it is at the covenant that means he keeps coming back. Perhaps it is the love of his life,
the camaraderie, or perhaps just the feeling that he fits in here.

+ **Fish Out Of Water (Terrain)** *(general, minor)*
This character has an affinity with one type of terrain, whether this is at sea, in the woods, the rolling hills,
or in the urban landscape of towns and cities, and feels uncomfortable and awkward when away from where he wants to be.
The character suffers a –1 penalty to all stress rolls taken outside of their favored terrain and also rolls one more
botch dice than normal in those situations.
Appropriate areas may be Cities & Towns, Villages, Rivers, The Sea, Mountains, Woodland, Desert, etc.
This Flaw may only be taken once, because taking it more than once makes it less serious, rather than more.

+ **Flashbacks** *(general, minor)*
When engaged in combat, or a similar violent and tense situation, the stress might trigger
a flashback to the horrors of past battles, which left this character mentally scarred.
The hallucinations seem so real that it is hard to avoid reacting to them. When an event
appropriate for the Flashbacks occurs, roll a stress die against an Ease Factor of 9. On
a failure, the character panics and revert to his past nightmares. At the storyguide’s
discretion, modifiers from –1 to –5 could apply, for things like full-scale battle,
fires, or stampeding animals. In addition, add or subtract any relevant Personality Traits,
depending on whether they might lessen or worsen the effects of this Flaw.
Bear in mind that positive traits like loyal, reliable, law-abiding, or calm should be
helpful in avoiding this affliction. Similarly, negative traits like selfish, angry, or
corrupt subtract from the roll, making him more likely to succumb. Often, his actions
hurt, embarrass, or offend comrades, employers, or other important people, and might have
social repercussions. On a botch, he’ll get into real trouble — it could result in someone
being seriously hurt or killed, in valuables being broken or in him failing in his duty at
a critical time.
For magi, this Flaw should not involve flashbacks to Twilight episodes, spell botches or
laboratory disasters. Since most of these situations won’t get worse by applying a penalty
to the rest of the scene, it won’t be enough of a Flaw. But magi can be affected by combat,
house fires, or cave-ins just as much as other character types.

+ **Gender Nonconforming** *(personality, minor or major)*
You do not conform to the expected behaviour for a person of the gender that your society would assign
to you in the absence of social cues such as clothes and behaviour. This may mean, for example,
that you dress as a member of another gender, or that you structure your life in a way considered appropriate
to another gender, or that you are sexually attracted to members of the same gender. It does not necessarily
mean that you disagree about what your gender is, although it may.
As a Minor Flaw, it does not normally cause you problems, whether because your society accepts your behaviour,
or because you can turn people who object into newts, or for some other reason. As a Major Flaw, it does cause you problems.

+ **Greedy** *(personality, minor or major)*
You like to eat and drink, and do so to excess whenever given the chance. You are probably
fat, but may not be if you rarely have the chance to indulge.

+ **Humble** *(personality, minor)*
You are humble, always willing to believe that others are more skilled and better than you. You do not necessarily
underestimate your own abilities, you just think others are better.

- **Missing Ear** *(general, minor)*
You cannot accurately locate the direction of sounds, and suffer a penalty of –3 to hearing rolls.

+ **No Sense of Direction** *(general, minor)*
You are completely unable to follow directions. North, south, east, and west have no meaning to you,
and you often confuse right and left. You frequently get lost while traveling unfamiliar paths by yourself,
or with others following your lead, and often have to reason your way home or to your destination from first principles.
This Flaw is incompatible with the Well-Traveled Virtue.

+ **Optimistic** *(personality, minor or major)*
You are convinced that everything will turn out for the best. This is not overconfidence, as you accept that you might
well fail. Even if you do, however, you are sure that circumstances will mean that everything works to your benefit.

+ **Pessimistic** *(personality, minor)*
You always expect the worst. You may try to enjoy yourself, but you are sure that anything that can go wrong, will, and will pick on you.

+ **Poor Memory** *(personality, minor)*
You have a very hard time recalling one type of thing, such as names, faces, or places.

+ **Reckless** *(personality, minor)*
You tend not to notice that situations are threatening. You start with a Personality Trait of Reckless +3, and can never 
have a positive Personality Trait reflecting care or patience. Whenever the storyguide deems it necessary for you to
check bravery or a similar Personality Trait, make a roll against your Reckless score instead. A success means you do not
realize your danger, and can act immediately without further checks.

- **Uncontrollable Strength**  *(general, minor)*
This character doesn’t know his own strength, and at times he has trouble controlling it.
This Flaw may not be taken if the character’s Strength is below 0. Whenever he handles delicate or fragile objects,
whenever care must be taken to knock somebody out gently, and so on, he risks overdoing it, severely.
The character must make a stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to avoid using too much power and causing
damage of some kind. In addition to this, any Strength Stress Roll uses one extra botch die.

+ **Worthless Abilities** *(general, minor)*
A time-lost character (see Chapter 7: Grog Templates) must have about 30 experience points that have been rendered valueless
by her shift in time. For example, she may have Area Lore of 3 for a city that no longer exists, or her Etiquette
score may have been rendered useless by changing social structures. Troupes may permit companions to purchase this Flaw multiple times.
In the example of the legionaries given in the Time-lost Witnesses template (see Chapter 7),
their wasted ability is their Organization Lore. The army to which it refers no longer exists.
