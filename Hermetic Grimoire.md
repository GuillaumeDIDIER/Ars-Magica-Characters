**Carvings of the Magus**  
ReHe 10  
**R:** Touch, **D:** Mom, **T:** Ind  
This spell carves a statue of a person or a creature from a single block of wood to use as a Sympathetic Connection. The piece of wood can be no larger than one cubic pace. This spell requires a Perception + Finesse roll with an Ease Factor of 12 to replicate the necessary Craft roll and the day's work. If this is botched the statue is ruined and it provide no bonus as a Connection. The model is good only for one use but there is a similar spell that craft a more precise statue that can be used as a long lasting representation (the Ease Factor is 18, as the work takes an entire month).

ReVi 20  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Dream, **T**: Ind  
This spell is similar to *Maintaining the Demanding Spell* but with Dream duration.
