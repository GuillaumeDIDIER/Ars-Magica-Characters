# Metillia, the Singer

Metillia is a very young girl that happened to uncover her powers very early. Many times, when she was singing some songs or even tunes, people around her felt particular emotions, often the emotion that Metillia felt in that moment. Several years ago, the witch Delia found Metillia and, given that the effects of the Gift were slowly ruining her life in the village and her relationships, the witch brought the girl to her coven in Tenno. There Metillia grew with her newfound sister Imilia and they are now best friend. Through Delia's aid and advices, Metillia found out that through her powers she could impose her will over other people and creatures and, even if at the beginning she was afraid of this power, she began to refine her abilities and how to use them.
