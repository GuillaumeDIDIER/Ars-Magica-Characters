# Eustachys, the Mechanicus

Eustachys was born into a wealthy family and has never lacked for anything from early childhood. As a young man he took advantage of his penchant for languages ​​to travel to Egypt and teach Liberal Arts and Philosophy to young nobles. However, he discovered his true passion at the age of 17, when he studied the arts of Heron's Mechanics, since then he has concentrated on creating constructs, also helped by the family finances. During his studies in the Library of Alexandria, Eustachys fell in love with Charikleia, also a scholar, and had a son, Isocrates. Their love seemed to last forever but, during an experiment on a construct, a collapse in the laboratory abruptly ended this idyllic dream, Eustachys was the only one to survive and did not come out unscathed, indeed. Now, he feels responsible for what happened to his wife and takes care of the young Isocrates with care and affection, even though he is sometimes seen staring into space, as if he wants to escape from this bad dream.

You probably live and work near the Alexandria, where the art of the Mechanicians is highly kept in regard and you have free access to the Library of Alexandria, granting you 25 XP every year (it's usually 15 XP) or 30 XP if you're Wealthy. Many of the Mechanicians also are crafters and teachers because you should still work two Season every year (or one if you're Wealthy).
