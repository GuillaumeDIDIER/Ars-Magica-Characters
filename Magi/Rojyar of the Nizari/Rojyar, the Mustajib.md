# Rojyar, the Mustajib

Rojyar is now a powerful member of the Nizari summoners but, before becoming a mustajib, he was initiated into the summoning arts bythe Mulhidun to be able to control demons and spirits. These initiations bound his magic to specific demons and one of them become really close to Royjar, she call herself Yassin. Royjar is a skilled poisoner, he can concoct poisons and then increase their potency using Physic, he is also able to change the humors in someone’s body to make them react in a predictable way. His goal is to serve the Nizari, while slowly but eventually becoming one of the most powerful *imam-qa’im*.

The Mulhidun is a Kurdish group of sorcerers in northern Persia, they are described in RoP:Ip.136-137.
