CrMe 10  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Mom, **T**: Ind  
This spell brings a dream to a sleeping person. The subject and the content is unknown but the caster can meddle with it using spells like Blissful Dreams and Melpomene’s Touch.  
*(Base 5, +1 Touch)*

**Melpomene's Touch**  
ReMe 15  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Dream, **T**: Ind  
This spell reshapes the dream of the sleeping person into a dream concerning a subject the magus decides at casting. Many dream magi use this spell before sleeping to establish the subject of the current dream or to interpret the signs in someone else’s dream.  
*(Base 5, +1 Touch, +1 Dream)*

**Guard of the Oneiropomp**  
CrIm 15  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Dream, **T**: Ind  
This spell is a dream version of Phantom of Human Form but at Dream duration. In dreams, illusions and conjured images have more substance than in the waking world.  
*(Base 2, +1 Touch,  +2 movement, +1 complexity, +1 Dream)*

**The Fountain of Soothing Dreams**  
CrIm 20  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Mom, **T**: Ind  
This spell creates a vis source of Imaginem dream vis in the shape a fountain. The Ritual nature of the spell lets the caster create a dream vis source that lasts across dreams and renews periodically each time the caster enters the dream (he’ll find 2 pawns of dream vis in the form of oniric water). This spell is common among members of the Volshebnii Mechtateli because this is an handy and fast way to have dream vis.  
*(Base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Size, +4 complexity; Ritual)*

**Opening the Portal to the Dreamscape**  
Mu(In)Me 30  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Dream, **T**: Ind  
This spell changes the current dream to incorporate a portal to the Dreamscape. The portal last as the original dream does, so that spiritual travelers can come back to the original dream.
This spell is usually taught after the dream magus has gained the trust of the Monarchs of the Veiled Court.
Similar spells exist that create portals to one’s imagination and memory, so that the traveler doesn’t need to search for a genuine one.  
*(Base 20, +1 Touch, +1 Dream)*

**Blissful Dreams**  
ReMe 20  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Sun, **T**: Ind  
This spell changes the dream of the sleeping person into a peaceful and calm dream. When he wakes up, the target gains a +2 bonus to rolls that require thought or concentration until the he sleeps again. There's an opposing version of this spell called Dreary Dreams that results in a -2 penalty.  
*(Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)*

**Recalling the Dream**  
InMe 20  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Conc, **T**: Ind  
This spell refresh the target's memory of his dream as it tends to fade very quickly when someone wakes up. The dream is remembered as if the target just woke up.  
*(Base 10, +1 Touch, +1 Conc)*

**Maintaining the Oneiromantic Spell**  
ReVi 20  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Dream, **T**: Ind  
This spell is similar to *Maintaining the Demanding Spell* but with Dream duration. It’s very common for dream magi to cast spontaneous spells while in spiritual form (because they are not bound by Fatigue) and this spell helps their Concentration spells to last longer. As with *Maintaining the Demanding Spell*, a Stamina + Concentration stress roll of 6+ must be made in order to cast this spell while keeping the first one going.  
*(Base Gen, +1 Touch, +1 Dream duration)*

**Erect the Dream Fortification**  
ReMe 25  
**R**: Personal, **D**: Dream, **T**: Ind  
This spell protects the caster from foreign dream manipulation of level less than or equal to 30. This spell is sometimes used by members of Volshebnii Mechtateli against their enemies in dreams, for them, it’s almost like an Aegis of the Heart while dreaming.  
*(Base 15, +1 Dream, +1 complexity)*

**Mystical Secrets of the Veiled Court**  
CrMe 30  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Mom, **T**: Ind  
This spell creates a perfect copy of a memory locus of the caster into the mind of the target. This spell is most common between the members of the Volshebnii Mechtateli because this is one of the methods to pass down the knowledge of Dream Magic through dreams. The memories are often books about the cult or lessons from a Mystagogue and they often are memories of memories of memories, someone thinks that some of them comes directly from Raisa, the first member of the Volshebnii Mechtateli.  
*(Base 5, +1 Touch, +4 complexity)*

**Curse of Morpheus**  
CrMe 20  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Sun, **T**: Ind  
This spell brings a nightmare to a sleeping person, with the caster's sigil being a key feature of the nightmare. The victim of this spell wakes up with a Long TermFatigue level lost. These Long Term Fatigue Levels are cumulative, so several bad nights leave him in bad shape. This spell was in vogue during the early times of the Volshebnii Mechtateli and was used, during the numerous marches, to wear down the enemy magi. The origin of this spell date back to Raisa who based it on the Weight of Thousand Hells spell.  
*(Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 complex effect)*
