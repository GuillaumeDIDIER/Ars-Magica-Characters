**Appearance:** Sofia is a thin woman with long silver-like hair, usually gathered together. She seems to always have her heads in the clouds, so she's clumsy and sometimes she doesn't seems to listen.
` `  
**Sigil:** Her hairs fluctuate while she is casting.
` `  
**Activities in the last fifteen years:** Sofia, 15 years out of apprentice, has developed many spells to help her in dreams. When she reached 35, she commisioned a Longevity Ritual to a specialist really close to her Mater and she gained a Longevity Ritual modifier of 16. Sofia has undergone an Initiation in the mystery of the Greater Dream Grimoire through the Volshebnii Mechtateli cult and now she knows the Monarchs of the Veiled Court. One of them helped her studying the lore of the Cult and they also gave her the Laboratory Text of ""Opening the Portal to the Dreamscape"" through the same ritual for her first initiation in Dream Magic.

##New Spells##

**Beginning of a Dream**
` `  
CrMe 10
` `  
R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind
` `  
This spell brings a dream to a sleeping person. The
subject and the content is unknown but the caster can
meddle with it using spells like Blissful Dreams and
Melpomene’s Touch.
` `  
(Base 5, +1 Touch)

**Melpomene's Touch**
` `  
ReMe 15
` `  
R: Touch, D: Dream, T: Ind
` `  
This spell reshapes the dream of the sleeping person into a dream concerning a subject the magus decides at casting. Many dream magi use this spell before sleeping to establish the subject of the current dream or to interpret the signs in someone else’s dream.
` `  
(Base 5, +1 Touch, +1 Dream)

**Guard of the Oneiropomp**
` `  
CrIm 15
` `  
R: Touch, D: Dream, T: Ind
` `  
This spell is a dream version of Phantom of Human Form but at Dream duration. In dreams, illusions and conjured images have more substance than in the waking world.
` `  
(Base 2, +1 Touch,  +2 movement, +1 complexity, +1 Dream)

**The Fountain of Soothing Dreams**
` `  
CrIm 20
` `  
R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind
` `  
This spell creates a vis source of Imaginem dream vis in the shape a fountain. The Ritual nature of the spell lets the caster create a dream vis source that lasts across dreams and renews periodically each time the caster enters the dream (he’ll find 2 pawns of dream vis in the form of oniric water). This spell is common among members of the Volshebnii Mechtateli because this is an handy and fast way to have dream vis.
` `  
(Base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Size, +4 complexity; Ritual)

**Opening the Portal to the Dreamscape**
` `  
Mu(In)Me 30
` `  
R: Touch, D: Dream, T: Ind
` `  
This spell changes the current dream to incorporate a portal to the Dreamscape. The portal last as the original dream does, so that spiritual travelers can come back to the original dream.
This spell is usually taught after the dream magus has gained the trust of the Monarchs of the Veiled Court.
Similar spells exist that create portals to one’s imagination and memory, so that the traveler doesn’t need to search for a genuine one.
` `  
(Base 20, +1 Touch, +1 Dream)
##Initiation Scripts##

*Form to Substance*
` `  
**Initiation Ease Factor:** 15 (Minor Virtue known
to the Mystagogue)
` `  
**Script Bonus:** +8
` `  
**Script Details:** The initiate must spend a real-world month in a dream trying to understand the core differences of form and substance within the dream, doing so he will gain the No Sense of Direction Flaw (+3 Minor Ordeal). Near the end of the season, the initiate must venture forth into the Labyrinth of Skophos, an evershifting structure in the Vermilion Temple of Wistful Sighs. His goal is to find the door to the Inner Chamber of the Temple also known as The Sanctuary of Lost Dreams, while surviving the terrible nightmares chained there (+3 Quest).
Upon reaching the Sanctuary he will be entrusted with tasks (+1 Time) from the Monarchs of the Veiled Court to prosecute the goals of the Eternal Dream (gaining the Greater Dream Grimoire Virtue).
