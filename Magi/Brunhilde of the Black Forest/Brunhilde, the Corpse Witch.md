# Brunhilde, the Corpse Witch

Brunhilde is a witch living in a cavern, deep inside the Black Forest. She sometimes receive visitors that seek aid from the *Bone Witch* and she helps by giving them herbs and various folk remedies. When she was younger, a group of villagers led by a priest discovered her performing strange rituals in the woods with dead bodies. The villagers beat her, gouged out her eye and did even worse to her but they left her in the woods thinking she would not survive the night. Thanks to the help of another witch, Brunhilde survived but swore vengeance against any priest and villager who had harmed a girl like her.
