# Dilwen of Merinita

Dilwen was born in particular circumnstances in a village of South Scandinavia. His father was an honest man, but he was tricked by an huldra to have a child. When he  found out her nature, in act of rage after finding out that the *monster* had a baby, he killed the huldra. The pain was more than enough for him and he tried but couldn't kill a little creature like Dilwen, because she had his eyes, so he left her in the woods and never came back. Dilwen was saved by the fae, probably because she was almost one of their kind and slowly but steadly she became a young woman. Years after, a maga from House Merinita named Anniki, found her and told her she had the Gift and that she could became a maga herself and Dilwen agreed to follow her but before leaving, she took with her a little friend, his name is Puff, a pixie that enjoys making pranks to the young couples. Dilwen's magic is strongly related to the Faerie Realm, she can easily learn magical effects by studying faerie creatures and she is really skilled in animating little objects.
