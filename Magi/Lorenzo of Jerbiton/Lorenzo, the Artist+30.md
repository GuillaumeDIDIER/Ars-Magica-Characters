**Activities in the last fifteen years:** In these fifteen years, Lorenzo continued his studies in the art of sculpture while creating new artworks and few new spells. He traveled a lot with his wife Violante, he went to Zara, to study a new technique with strange tools from East Europe and, in the meanwhile, he sold quite a few of his marble statues.

>**Harder than Iron**  
MuTe 24

## New Spells

**Lord of the Statues**  
ReTe 25  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Conc, **T**: Part  
This spell  make a stone or a clay statue move under the direct control of the caster with precise movements. A stone statue striking with an arm has Initiative +3, Attack +7, Damage +12. Normal weapons are practically useless against a stone statue (consider an high Soak if you want to really damage it). A clay statue is much weaker, reduce the Damage to +8 and normal weapons may damage it. For a Size +3 statue you should add +6 Damage and -4 Initiative and you might also add a bonus to Attack using the Aiming rules in ArM Core pp. 86. Part is necessary for statues that have a base to stand.  
*(Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +1 Conc, +1 stone, +1 precise movements, +1 Size)*

**The Warped Mannequin**  
CrVi 10  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Mom, **T**: Ind  
This spell inflicts one Warping Point to its target. Lorenzo uses this spell when he creates a statue that he doesn't like, he repeteadly cast this spell to warp the statue into something different, some statues may gain consciousness through this weird process.
*(Base 5, +1 Touch)*
