**Appearance:** Lorenzo is a young man with blonde hair, he usually dresses with expensive white clothes, when he have to attend some event or at the covenant, or his work clothes, when he's sculpting.  
**Sigil:** His right hand shines as touched by light.

**Activities in the last fifteen years:** In these fifteen years, Lorenzo reached an Artistic Reputation of 7 and gained a Muse, granting him a Personal Power. Lorenzo created some moving statues to help him in his laboratory and recently came in contact with an association of wizards that may have something he wants, this order is the Augustan Brotherhood. One of them approached Lorenzo as a benefactor to order a statue but then Lorenzo found out he was interested in his magical capabilities. Lorenzo was quite astonished to know that there were other magicians capable of so many magical feats but the most remarkable to him was the Practice of Animo, maybe his new friend may teach that to him, well, after a just reward or a bargain. Lorenzo will also try to reach Artistic Reputation 11 and become a Legendary Artist but it will be difficult, he needs to find a wealthy patron soon and, to slowly reach Reputation 10, he will need an Aesthetic Quality of at least 31 (The Major Muse obtained at Artistic Reputation 9 could grant him the *Life-Linked Art* Virtue to achieve his goals).
