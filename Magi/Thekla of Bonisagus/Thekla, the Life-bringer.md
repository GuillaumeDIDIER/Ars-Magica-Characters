# Thekla, the Life-bringer
Thekla is a young maga in the Theban Tribunal, she was raised by a commoner family when she was found by her parens, Dositheos. She always had a knack for animating small objects and make them do what she wanted, but she struggled with Corpus and Creo. Even though she is young, she has already been through bad experiences, she lost two child, they were stillborn. Her parens and Thekla think that this might be related to her struggle with those Arts. Even before his Gauntlet, she already set her intelligent mind on goal that someone might call God-defying, she wants to *create life*. She deluded herself that her ability to animate matter could help her to surpass the Father himself, and doing so she attracted the evil thirst of some demons, that took interest in her journey.
