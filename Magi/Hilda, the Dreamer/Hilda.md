# Hilda

Hilda is a young girl tormented by some pesky demons. The demons slipped into her head through her dreams and now resides within her, advising her, empowering her and controlling her. They disguise themselves as Hilda's imaginary friends that she created because no children wanted to play with her. The demons maybe helped her initially, but now they feast on the angry moments that Hilda sometimes experience and when she manifest her powers. She can create phantasm of unnatural things and things that she imagine with the power of her mind, or at least this is what she thinks. She channel her powers by being angry and by stating what horrible things should happen, those things sometimes really happen.
