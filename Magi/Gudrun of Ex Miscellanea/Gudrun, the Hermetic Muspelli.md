# Gudrun, the Hermetic Muspelli

Gudrun was born in the southern part of Denmark by his father Troels, an Hermetic Muspelli. During the Great War against the Order of Odin, a powerful Muspelli named Svend and others Muspelli had a vision of the future, the war couldn't be won but the Ragnarok wasn't out of reach if they swapped sides. So, with this knowledge, they sworn their oath to the Order of Hermes and fought their brothers in the war, many fell, but others survived and Svend became one of the first Hermetic Muspelli. He trained a copious amount of young gifted children with the help a pralician maga, Annika and one of these children was Troels, Gudrun's father. Annika and Svend found out that the same muspelli rite to gain a patron's favor could be similarly done for gifted children before opening their Arts and they succeded with partially joining Muspelli and Hermetic Magic. Gudrun was born in a covenant with many muspelli and pralician magi and this makes her sometimes *alienated* to the whole Order of Hermes, many other magi don't really understand her traditions. The war has ended many years ago but there still are survivors of the original Muspelli that sworn vengeance against the Traitors and they usually try to kill them when they found one.

Svend and the other hermetic muspelli created a Mystery Cult around their Muspelli Lore and the stealthly uncovered a way to give the young gifted apprentices the Etin-Mod, this however intertwine their newfound form and their Hermetic Magic in a unpredictable way. [This is an Initiation Script for a Major Supernatural Virtue *Etin-Mod* that also grants *Necessary Condition (in Etin-mod)* but only those who possess the *Mythic Blood* Virtue could be initiated.]
