# Baqir Al-Andalus of ex Miscellanea

Baqir was born near the Covenant of Almunecar, a covenant of hermetic sahirs. He was left there by her young mother that didn't want a child and one woman of the covenant brought him in the covenant and raised him. The magi soon found out that he had the Gift and one of the magi, Hamid Al-Mursi, took him as a his apprentice. Baqir studied the arts of the sahirs, how to summon jinn and to bargain with them as well as hermetic arts. When dealing with one particular jinn, Mus'ab an Ifrit, Baqir caught his attention, probably because of his immunity to fire and, since that time, Mus'ab hasn't left Baqir's side, he probably enjoys tormenting him while giving him a tiny bit of his power in the form of Ignem vis. Baqir recently departed to North Africa with other magi to establish a new covenant near Pelusium.
