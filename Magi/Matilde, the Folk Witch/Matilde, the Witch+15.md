## New Virtues

**Enriching Infusion**  
*Minor Supernatural Virtue*

The Folk Witch may create enriched objects or herbs by infusing vis containing items with blood in her cauldron. Firstly, she chooses a General or Supernatural Virtue that the item will grant, secondly, she chooses an appropriate item (an appropiate herb or object) that will grant the chosen virtue. To infuse an item with a Virtue, a Folk Witch mixes the chosen item with blood from a creature that possess the chosen virtue, the process is similar to creating a potion using a Magic Lore Laboratory Total (Int + Magic Lore + Folk Witch Theory + Aura).  

| **Virtue**                | **Minimum Brew Potency** | **Base Cost** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Minor General Virtue      | 12                       | 2             |
| Minor Supernatural Virtue | 15                       | 3             |
| Major General Virtue      | 18                       | 4             |
| Major Supernatural Virtue | 21                       | 5             |

To infuse Major Virtue, a considerable amount of blood from the creature is needed and the item should give/have an appropriate Minor Flaw.  
An item created this way is automatically enriched and the base duration of item is 1 years but it may be extended using additional doses. Additional doses add that much years to the duration of the item and the doses may be also split into several identical items (years of duration need to be split too).
