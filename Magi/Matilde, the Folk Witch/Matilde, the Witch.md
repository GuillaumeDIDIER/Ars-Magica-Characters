# Matilde, the Witch

Matilde was born into a poor family and his parents blamed her for every mistake she and her brothers made. Her Gift impaired her so much during her childhood that she didn't have many friends, she usually wandered in the woods in search of animals and herbs. One day her father abandoned her during a trip in the woods and she was found by Catarina, a witch whose home was on a mountain. Catarina became her teacher and opened her Gift into the Folk Witch tradition. Matilde quickly found his new abilities very useful and enjoyed this new powers. During her studies Matilde found that her powers are somewhat tied to her hair, she found that she must have her hair long and free for her to make use of magic, cut her hair or tie them, and she is powerless. Matilde finished her apprenticeship under her teacher already 7 years ago and, recently, she founded a new coven near the swamp of Venice with his *sister* Ida, there she saved three young girls that now are her apprentices.
