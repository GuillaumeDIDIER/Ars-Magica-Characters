After that she need to find one Herb of Virtue and let it soak in the blood for a season (+3 Quest) and, at the end of the season, she has to drink the blood with the soaked herb, gaining the Hallucinations Flaw (+3 Minor Ordeal) and the Enriching Cultivation Virtue.

## New Virtues

**Enriching Infusion**  
*Minor Supernatural Virtue*

The Folk Witch may create enriched objects or herbs by infusing vis containing items with blood in her cauldron. Firstly, she chooses a General or Supernatural Virtue that the item will grant, secondly, she chooses an appropriate item (an appropiate herb or object) that will grant the chosen virtue. To infuse an item with a Virtue, a Folk Witch mixes the chosen item with blood from a creature that possess the chosen virtue, the process is similar to creating a potion using a Magic Lore Laboratory Total (Int + Magic Lore + Folk Witch Theory + Aura).  

| **Virtue**                | **Minimum Brew Potency** | **Base Cost** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Minor General Virtue      | 12                       | 2             |
| Minor Supernatural Virtue | 15                       | 3             |
| Major General Virtue      | 18                       | 4             |
| Major Supernatural Virtue | 21                       | 5             |

To infuse Major Virtue, a considerable amount of blood from the creature is needed and the item should give/have an appropriate Minor Flaw.  
An item created this way is automatically enriched and the base duration of item is 1 years but it may be extended using additional doses. Additional doses add that much years to the duration of the item and the doses may be also split into several identical items (years of duration need to be split too).  

**Witches' Rituals**  
*Major Supernatural Virtue*  

With this virtue, the Folk Witch can build up powerful effects using her Supernatural Abilities. She can modify the effect of her Supernatural abilties by varying the base Range, Duration and Target. To do so, she uses the Ease Factor as the base level, and alter the base Range, Duration, and Target of the effect by adding 3 levels for each magnitude of change needed. She can build the effect slowly by accumulating excess points from Casting Total (Characteristic + Supernatural Ability + Aura + Bonus + Simple Die) vs EF 9 each hour. Each hour she'll have to do a Deprivation roll, possibly gaining Fatigue Levels and malus to successive rolls. If the witch reaches the Unconscious Level before completing the ritual, treat it like if an *utiseta* is ended prematurely, incurring in botches, Warping Points and possibly Witch's Moon. When the cumulative points equal or exceed the Effect Level, the folk ritual effect will happen.  
The Penetration for the ritual is equal to Total Ritual Points - Ritual Level and a Witch can perform a longer ritual (by adding hours to the casting time) to boost her Penetration.  
If the Ritual level is higher than 21, the ritual requires a number of pawn of appropriate vis equal to half the Magnitude of the Ritual rounded up, in a form of a sacrificed object or animal.  
A Witch can also cast the ritual in a much faster way and without spending vis like a Formulaic spell. Similarly, she accumulates excess points from Casting Total (Characteristic + Supernatural Ability + Aura + Bonus + Stress Die) vs EF 12 until the cumulative points equal or exceed the level of the ritual. The ritual effect will happen and the Witch will lose Fatigue Levels equal to the number of cumulative rolls except the first one, if the Witch doesn't have enough Fatigue Levels, she will need to Soak damage equal to 5  for every additional Fatigue level spent, plus a stress die (as Life Boost). Only rituals of level equal or less to 21 can be cast in this way and the Witch can't perform longer fast rituals to boost her Penetration.  
A Witch can invent rituals by spending XP equal to the Magnitude (Level / 3) of the chosen ritual (these XP can be from Sources like: Practice, Adventure or XP gained in Folk Magic Theory), after that she can cast it.
