**Coven:** Matilde lives alone again, given that Giovanna finished her apprenticeship few years ago and joined a coven in northern Italy.

**Activities in the last fifteen years:** In these fifteen years Matilde developed new theriacs with the help of Giovanna and new magic items. She had some trouble with other witches given her proximity to the hermetic covenant but Matilde managed to fend off any malicious witch and then asked for protection to the magi. She finally swore the Oath to the Order of Hermes and gained the Parma Magica, a useful tool against those nasty witches. Her Longevity Ritual kept her alive when she had an Aging Crisis but she had to devise a new Longevity Ritual, gaining a -9 bonus this time. More than ten years ago, Matilde openend the Gift of Giovanna and taught her many abilities and secrets and, a few years ago, Giovanna was ready to become a witch and finished her apprenticeship by crafting her personal broom. Matilde, feeling alone again, searched for a familiar and she found Creek, a Raven of Virtue, a perfect match for her. She bound Creek as her familiar and taught him a bit a Folk Witch Theory.

**Familiar**: Creek, a Raven of Virtue (Magic Might 9, Int +1, Folk Magic Theory 1).

## New Virtues

**Enriching Infusion**  
*Minor Supernatural Virtue*

The Folk Witch may create enriched objects or herbs by infusing vis containing items with blood in her cauldron. Firstly, she chooses a General or Supernatural Virtue that the item will grant, secondly, she chooses an appropriate item (an appropiate herb or object) that will grant the chosen virtue. To infuse an item with a Virtue, a Folk Witch mixes the chosen item with blood from a creature that possess the chosen virtue, the process is similar to creating a potion using a Magic Lore Laboratory Total (Int + Magic Lore + Folk Witch Theory + Aura).  

| **Virtue**                | **Minimum Brew Potency** | **Base Cost** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Minor General Virtue      | 12                       | 2             |
| Minor Supernatural Virtue | 15                       | 3             |
| Major General Virtue      | 18                       | 4             |
| Major Supernatural Virtue | 21                       | 5             |

To infuse Major Virtue, a considerable amount of blood from the creature is needed and the item should give/have an appropriate Minor Flaw.  
An item created this way is automatically enriched and the base duration of item is 1 years but it may be extended using additional doses. Additional doses add that much years to the duration of the item and the doses may be also split into several identical items (years of duration need to be split too).
