**Equipment:** A staff, herbs and many Casting Items in her pouch, 2 potions of Healing (Medium Wound), 2 bottle of Aphrodisiac.

**Appearance:** Matilde is a beautiful woman except for a burn mark on her cheek, a priest marked her when she was young and she tried to blend the mark with a tattoo. She usually wear long clothes and a cloak to cover his head when she sneaks in the village.

**Coven:** Matilde now lives with a new daughter, Giovanna. She's a little young girl with the Gift and Matilde is willing to Open her Gift in the next few years.

**Activities in the last fifteen years:** In these fifteen years Matilde continued to refine her abilities expecially Hex and Folk Witch Theory. She dedicated herself to the creation of Magic Items through Lesser Craft Magic and her new way to enrich items. She wanted to find a familiar but she wasn't lucky in her adventures and promised to get better in Animal Ken to bind a familiar. In the meantime, Matilde found a new little girl that needed help and so she welcomed her to her home without hesitation, this girl is Giovanna, she's gifted and Matilde wants her to be her gifted apprentice. During these years, Matilde slowly approached the group of magi of the near covenant and they tried to convinced her to join the Order of Hermes but she wasn't interested and, given that they had bigger problems than a Folk Witch, the magi did not worry too much. However this is not the case for the other witches, this event wasn't seen very well by the other covens and they began to grow suspicious of her.

In these fifteen years, Matilde found and enriched a Mistletoe of Virtue that granted her the Divination Ability but, after trying to recreated this herb, she created this new version of the Mistletoe of Virtue that grants the Premonitions Ability (with a score of 3) for 3 years because this new Mistletoe of Virtue was infused with 5 pawns of Intellego.

Matilde recreated a rather famous herb of Virtue often found in nature using a mundane blackthorn soaked in her blood for a season. This Blackthorn of Virtue functions in the same way of the usual one but contains 5 pawns of Perdo and so it last only 1 year.

## New Virtues

**Enriching Infusion**  
*Minor Supernatural Virtue*

The Folk Witch may create enriched objects or herbs by infusing vis containing items with blood in her cauldron. Firstly, she chooses a General or Supernatural Virtue that the item will grant, secondly, she chooses an appropriate item (an appropiate herb or object) that will grant the chosen virtue. To infuse an item with a Virtue, a Folk Witch mixes the chosen item with blood from a creature that possess the chosen virtue, the process is similar to creating a potion using a Magic Lore Laboratory Total (Int + Magic Lore + Folk Witch Theory + Aura).  

| **Virtue**                | **Minimum Brew Potency** | **Base Cost** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Minor General Virtue      | 12                       | 2             |
| Minor Supernatural Virtue | 15                       | 3             |
| Major General Virtue      | 18                       | 4             |
| Major Supernatural Virtue | 21                       | 5             |

To infuse Major Virtue, a considerable amount of blood from the creature is needed and the item should give/have an appropriate Minor Flaw.  
An item created this way is automatically enriched and the base duration of item is 1 years but it may be extended using additional doses. Additional doses add that much years to the duration of the item and the doses may be also split into several identical items (years of duration need to be split too).
