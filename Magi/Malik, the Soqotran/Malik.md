# Malik, the Soqotran Sorcerer

Malik was born from the union of a man and a Jinniyah. One of them, seeking vitality, took the role of a mother and Malik was her gift to her husband. Malik inherited many capabilities from her mother, in particular his connection with magic and also, as many jinn, a malediction, he is bound by the bargains he make. He was brought to the Socotra isle when he was very little and then studied the Olibanum art under his master Muayyad. During this period, he made friend with Omoch, a medium Olibanum serpent that became his spirit ally. His magic is focused on controlling, as any Olibanum sorcerer, but he had some time to refine his other arts, especially Myrrh magic and the faerie powers it can grant.
