**Opening the Intangible Tunnel**  
ReVi lvl 30  
**R:** Arc, **D:** Con, **T:** Ind  
You can open a magical channel from yourself to some target, allowing you to cast any spell with a range greater than Personal on that target. The tunnel does not, of itself, grant any sense impressions of the target — you must cast appropriate spells through it if you wish to see. Spells cast through the tunnel cannot be of higher level than that of this spell. You must make standard Concentration rolls to maintain concentration on the Opening spell as you cast
other spells. A magus who magically recognizes the tunnel (through The Invisible Eye Revealed or a similar spell) may cast spells through the tunnel
back at you, and he need not concentrate on keeping the tunnel open. If this magus is the target of the spell, he is considered to be touching you. Otherwise, his effective range to you is his range to the target of the tunneling spell. If the target of the spell has Magic Resistance, you must penetrate that resistance to open the tunnel. Spells cast through the tunnel must also penetrate Magic Resistance normally.  
Spells lvl 30 or less can be cast through.    
*(Base effect, +4 Arc, +1 Conc)*
