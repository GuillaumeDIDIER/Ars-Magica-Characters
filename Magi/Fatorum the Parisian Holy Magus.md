# Adam Fatorum filius Anacrôn  
   
A Holy Magus in Paris, member of the Covenant of *Eboris*, Hermetic Filius of Anacrôn the King of Beggars, and pretty mediocre Holy Magus (A term he dislikes, as he is no more Holy than his Pater himself, who is clearly not that high in the ranking).   
Adam has no specialty, but due to his status as a Holy Magus you will probably see him trying to learn Rituals in the future, or just immerse himself in the intrigues of Parisian, Hermetic, or even more occult societies.   

A more detailed backstory and story seeds are given, Adam has been built as any character using standard rules but is intended to be used as an NPC.

**I am the Liege of the Land**    
Cr(Re)He 20   
**R:** Presence, **D:** Sun, **T:** Ind    
Creates a group of vines which obey the caster, actions more precise than waddling around require a Finnese roll.

**Last step to Hell**    
PeVi 10  
**R:** Presence, **D:** Mom, **T:** Sin  
Reduces a demon's Might Score by 10.

*(General Base 3, +2 Presence)*  
  
**The Evening Bell tolls for the Accursed**    
PeVi 5  
**R:** Presence, **D:** Mom, **T:** Sin  
Reduces a demon's Might Score by 5. The Sin Target is redundant.

*(General Base 2, +2 Presence)*

PeVi 5  
**R:** Presence, **D:** Mom, **T:** Sin

**The Evening Bell tolls for the Banished**    
PeVi 5  
**R:** Presence, **D:** Mom, **T:** Sin   
Reduces a Magic Being's Might Score by 5.

*(General Base 2, +2 Presence)*  
   
   
**You have done well**    
ReMe 10  
**R:** Presence, **D:** Mom, **T:** Individual    
The target instantly falls asleep.   
Used so that an anxious parent or worker could sleep well in spite of his obligations, this spell has regrettably only seen use to sleep away childrens he doesn't want to deal with.

**Ready the flock of the Lord!**    
ReMe 20   
**R:** Presence, **D:** Mom, **T:** Group   
Makes a standard group instantly rouse into alert readiness.

*(Base Effect 2, +2 Presence, +2 Faith)*   
    
     
**A Play for the Orphans**     
CrIm 10   
**R:** Presence, **D:** Mom, **T:** Group   
Creates a visual and auditory illusion in the guise of a small doll dressed as the caster wishes (A finesse roll is needed for an elaborate outfit), it follows the directions of the caster, but the caster needs to be on range for the illusion to be ordered.   
This spell is used so that he can entertain the children near the church he goes to when their parents are occupied. Due to his Painful Magic this is tiring and he normally stutters mid line or forgets what play he is doing.   
His Side Effect and Warped Magic make him seem like Christ is narrating the tales he gives, like an overjoyed parent and friend.   
*(Base Effect 2, +1 Touch, +1 Office, +1 Clear Words and Features, +2 Follows the Caster's directions)*   
   
**Command the essece in the wind**    
ReMe 20    
**R:** Presence, **D:** Mom, **T:** Group   
Allows one to move a single clump of Vis from any place in Presence Range to any container in the same range.   
Adam uses this effect to gather the Divinely Tainted Vis which gathers on the roofs of the cathedrals, the concentrated Mentem Vis in the University halls, the Imaginem Vis formed on the artwork the King appreciates, or the Perdo Vis which generate on the slums of the city.    
*(Base Effect 10, +2 Presence)*   
   
**No Family will be torn apart**    
CrCo 25   
**R:** Touch, **D:** 40, **T:** Individual

*(Base Effect 5, +3 Fourty, +1 Touch)*   
    
**Endurance of the Martyrs**     
ReCo 15   
Like Endurance of the Berskers (See Core Book page 134) but with Office Duration.   
Used by Adam so that his Painful Magic won't hinder him too much, due to the eventual fatigue he will endure he prefers to only use it when needed.   
   
**Ending the Petty Squabble**    
ReCo 20  
**R:** Presence, **D:** Con, **T:** Individual   
Holds the body of a Corpus target (Size of -1 to +1) motionless for as long as the Caster concentrates.   
Made so that Adam could stop an agressor from hitting a victim, this spell has only been used once so that an assault may be stopped.   
*(Base Effect 5, +2 Presence, +1 Concentration)*   
    
    
Of the same Ex Miscellanea Tradition as Anacrôn the King of Beggas, his original Pater (Which he shares with Anacrôn) had kidnapped him and opened his Gift by impaling him through the chest with a spear (The Opening of the Gift of their Tradition adds a great injury so that their Death Prophecy and Personal Vis Source can manifest).   
This unusual opening worked, and his Tradition's Virtues were acquired with no problem.   
Shortly after this, his Pater decided to experiment more, and nine days Christmas he impaled the boy once again, leaving him to suffer a gruesome death. Five days after, the corpse was found inside a home that his Pater had left him in, no trace of magic in the home was found.   
Adam's Pater apparently left after the murder, which was only found because the body was found by Anacrôn, who orchestrated it so that local authorities would catch wind of it, along with giving a Quaesitor enough evidence to rightfully blame his Pater, the nearly immortal Magus (For his own Death Prophecy was probably decades from fullfiling) got his Pater to leave the Tribunal, and (Surprisingly) gave good burial to his Hermetic brother.   
Eight years later, on the anniversary of his death, the family of the boy left a simple Bible they had cherished as a heirloom as their last gift, thinking this was going to be all they could do.   
Unsurprisingly (As the character sheet isn't of a ghost) Adam was brought back by a merciful Saint, amidst the gathered townsfolk. The commotion was enough that he became a celebrity of sorts, and the clergy found that this weirdly inquisitve child was helping them to keep some moderation of calmness to the normally university hating sides of the city.   
They became instantly dissapointed Anacrôn claimed it was his right to train him as an apprentice, but this didn't stop the child from helping their goals, his constant alms and later prodigous "Findings of food" helped everyone... Until a new Covenant was formed.   
Eboris changed the whole playing field, as Paris was now the Senex of the Covenant and the boy's activities had to be limited way more. However, after becoming a Gauntleted Magus means he got permission to join the Covenant, and has been a somewhat weird mediator between all the factions on Paris, and one in quite a precarious position.   
While he holds the protection of the Church amidst the upper echelons of mundane society, this doesn't extend to Hermetic circles (From which Anacrôn doesn't even advise him about). However, his dealings with both mundanes, his ease of access to the two biggest sources of information in the Tribunal (Anacrôn and Archmagus Mathieus of Eboris), along with his tolerance and even lack of care about any past misdeeds (Some even say he would shelter Himnis the Mad or Diedne herself if asked nicely enough), has made him quite the quested for ally.    
Gifts and (Mostly disingenous) proposals have been given, mostly while in disguises of many sorts, but only one by Cunfin (An exchange of Laboratory Texts and a promise of mutual help in the face of a Wizard's War) and another by a Trianomae Maga have been accepted.   
She offered to ward his building against Vermin using her spells, but this "Ring" spell didn't correspond to Hermetic Magic, as it merely took a few etchings in the wood and it has kept itself warding his Sancta against Vermin (And perhaps something else too...)   
As a show of trust she gave him a simple book, she called it an Awakened Item who could serve as an ally, a good Summa, or perhaps even as a Familiar.    
This book is indeed alive, aligned to the Magic Realm, and claims to have served the lineage of that Maga for centuries. Her ability over the Art of Memory is prodigious and as she holds enough knowledge of the Divine Realm, she serves as the book that Adam uses for his spell casting.   
   
A sufficiently interested Quaesitor (Or Tytalus seeking some blackmail) can see that this backstory doesn't make sense, Adam holds Holy Magic, which no one taught him, he couldn't have learnt it himself as he never had True Faith, and no angel could have taught him.     
The Trianomae Maga doesn't seem to exist, and her spell resembles that of a Columbae way more, and not even in Durenmar are there notes of a Lineage of Trianomae who held an Awakened Book. To top it off, parting with such a valuable resource seems like a weirdly bad choice.   
Who taught Adam his Holy Magic? Who was that woman? Why was the boy killed in the first place if his Gift had already opened and their tradition held no further Mysteries? And just what is this book, and why are her pages scribbled in this rune-like alphabet, holding family trees that go further than any other?   
  
Adam has named his Familiar with the name of Gestia, for she has told many tales about Flambeau the Founder and his fights in the Normandy and Stonehenge Tribunal which no one else had heard about.   
   
Powers infused on the Familiar Bond  
Talking to the Mystic (Gestia)   
CrMe 15   
Creates thoughts, emotions and images in the mind of Adam.    
A common enchantment for the Familiar Bond, Gestia uses it the most as Adam's Restriction means he only uses it to talk silently, if he doesn't have Gestia then he's probably in a pinch already!   
(Base 4, +1 Touch, 10 levels for Unlimited Uses)  
   
Talking to my Friend   
CrMe 15   
Creates thoughts, emotions and images in the mind of Gestia.    
A common enchantment for the Familiar Bond, Adam barely uses it as his Restriction means he can't use this to talk over distances (Not like Gestia can walk away).   
(Base 4, +1 Touch, 10 levels for Unlimited Uses)   
   
A Personal Accuser (Gestia)   
PeMe 20   
Quells an emotion so that it doesn't lead to sins like Anger, Greed, Lust, and so on.   
As such sins are voiding of virtues one can have a hard time understanding when to quell an emotion, righteously seeking justice can easily turn to anger, and regular love can lead to lust. Of course, there's nothing this can do about Sloth!   
(Base 5, +1 Touch, 10 levels for Unlimited Uses)
