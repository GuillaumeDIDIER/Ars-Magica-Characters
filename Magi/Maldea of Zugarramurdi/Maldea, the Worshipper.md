# Maldea, the Worshipper
Maldea was born in a small village nestled in the rugged mountains of the Basque Country. From a young age, she was different from other children, with piercing green eyes that seemed to hold ancient secrets. Her presence often coincided with sudden changes in weather, causing her parents, simple shepherds, to both love and fear her, seeking to shield her from the villagers' superstitions.
At the age of eight, Maldea was drawn into a nearby cave during a fierce storm. There, she encountered Mari, the ancient earth goddess revered by the Sorginak. Mari revealed that Maldea was chosen to be her herald, a bridge between the mortal world and the chthonic realm. Blessed with extraordinary abilities and a profound affinity for Magic Lore, Maldea made a spiritual pact with Mari, vowing to serve and protect her mysteries.
