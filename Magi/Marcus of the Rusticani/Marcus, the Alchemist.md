# Marcus of the Rusticani

Marcus was born in a relatively safe place, in an hermetic covenant. From young age, he found out that he was different, many people around him didn't really understand him because he enjoyed things that were *more feminine*, as they said. He felt like he was bound to rules he didn't understand nor chose, and for that he usually felt lonely and misunderstood. A new world began when he became an apprentice under his master Jerome of ex Miscellanea, a magus of the covenant who had set his sights on the boy a few years earlier. Marcus started a new life, no more misunderstood but embraced by a community as weird as him. Marcus is skilled in woodcrafting and alchemy, like his parens, and he trained to use Rego craft magic very skillfully but he isn't very good with Perdo magic. There is another magus that set his sights on this young promising boy, he is Claudius of Verditius, he tried to win Marcus as apprentice using a Certamen against Jerome without success, but he did not give up, he sworn that if he can't have him, nobody should.
