# Felix of Mercere

Felix was born in the *cadet branch* of the Mercere bloodline that passes the Mutantum powers. He studied from young age the liberal arts, how to behave properly in many occasion and also a bit of music. As with all the gifted Mercere, he was quickly found and began his apprenticeship. His magic is specialized in physical transportation and so he was always amazed by the Mercere portals, he felt a sort of connection. Recently some frictions began between the two branches of the Mercere bloodline and this sometimes troubles him but he tries not to get too bothered by this feud and, instead, focuses on studying the portals and on how to replicate them.
