# Flaminia, Fire in the Night
As a child, Flaminia was wild and willful, spending her days wandering through the ancient woods that whispered of the old gods, the ones her mother warned her never to disturb. But one day, when Flaminia was only nine, a traveling merchant struck her younger brother during an argument. In a fit of rage, she shoved the man—who promptly stumbled into a campfire. To everyone’s astonishment, the flames seemed to grow, fueled by her fury, dancing higher as if at her command. This raw, uncontrollable burst of flame didn’t go unnoticed. She was soon sent to live with an elder of the Soranus Witches who recognized her fiery gift and sought to teach her to master it.  
With her newfound power and the help of a mischievous fire elemental, Flaminia began a life of rebellion. She found herself drawn to others who were cast out, leading her to form a gang of outcasts and bandits. Her reputation grew, not only for her prowess with fire but for the strange "wolves" who ran at her side—thieves clad in the enchanted wolf skins she crafted, which allowed them to hunt and fight with the swiftness and fury of wolves. She became known as an outlaw leader, feared by merchants and noblemen alike, her wrath infamous among those who dared cross her.

*Burn*, 0 points, Init -2, Ignem  
**R:** Touch, **D:** Sun, **T:** Ind  
Anyone touching or being touched by a fire elemental takes damage equal to a stress die plus the entity’s current Might pool. This is the usual melee attack of a phlegethus. Any flammable material catches fire on contact; typically, clothes inflict +10 damage per round on their wearer until they are extinguished. Any metal coming into contact with the elemental’s body for more than a round heats up, causing the effects of Heat of the Searing Forge, but this does not include weapons that attempt to strike it in combat.  
Level 30 effect (base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 requisite, +1 constant effect), Greater Power (30 levels, 4 mastery points: -3 Might cost, +1 Init)  
  
*Crafter of Ignem*, variable points, Init variable+2, Ignem  
**R:** varies, **D:** varies, **T:** varies  
Duplicates any of a range of non-Ritual Creo or Rego spells pertaining to the specified Hermetic Form, at a cost of 1 Might point per magnitude of the effect. The level of the effect cannot be greater than 25.  
Level 25 effect (CrIg and ReIg), Focus Power (25 levels, 4 mastery points: +10 levels, +2 Init ) 
  
*Pocket Fire*, 0 points, Init -2, Ignem  
**R:** Per, **D:** Constant, **T:** Ind  
This power shrinks the fire elemental to a Size -5 while leaving its powers and Might untouched. In this small form, the flame are denser and they have an heavy red color.  
If the fire elemental is given space to grow and fuel to feed on, he might regain its original Size but they will shrink again to Size -5 when the fuel is all burned up.
