# Varvara, the Necromancer
Varvara was born in an Ex Miscellanea covenant where most of the members were of her tradition. Their tradition was a peculiar one, some Guernicus are really attentive of their doings because some of their powers are supposedly related to the infernal and to the practice of necromancy. Her tradition have a way to bind spirits, but usually ghosts, to people and objects, they use their necromantic abilities to help the members of the covenant by binding ghosts of ancestors to them. These ghosts an help their descendants by boosting their abilities and their longevity while also having a way to talk with them. Some of the most powerful ghosts than can possess a corpse are usually bound to a corpse of a person in a way that gives a new life to both the person and the ghost. These walking corpses become something like magical items and they are usually imbued with powers to maintain the corpse free of rot. Varvara took her Gauntlet recently and she prepared herself to sustain her covenant as the other members before her, she also has a ghost companion, the ghost of his childhood friend, Mikail, who died falling down in a chasm not far away from the covenant.
