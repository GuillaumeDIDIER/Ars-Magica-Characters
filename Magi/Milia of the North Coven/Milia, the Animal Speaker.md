# Milia, the Animal Speaker  

Milia is a young witch that has a special connection with animals, in particular with birds. When she was little, whenever she sang, birds came to her to be entertained by the music and the songs. She always preferred the company of the birds rather than children of her age, something that she didn't understand made them hate her. Even her parents sometimes were scared and irritated by her and one day a known witch came to their house to get her, because the parents could manager her anymore.  
Under the teachings of the witch, Milia refined her ability to summon animals and recently she fell in love with a young knight, Emerik. He is a disgraced knight who now is working as a mercenary along with some of his companions. During one of their amorous adventures, Emerik was challanged, defeated and the cursed by a Faerie knight, in the process of defending him, Milia suffered a malediction: every night she transform into a big hawk and then day after she has no memory of what happened during the night.
