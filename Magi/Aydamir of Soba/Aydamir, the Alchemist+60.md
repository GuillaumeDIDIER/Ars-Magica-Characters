**Appearance:** Aydamir is young dark-skinned man who usually wears the traditional Soban alchemists clothes. Many people find his gaze a little disturbing but he doesn't care that much, even though he usually spends his time in the laboratory the Ministry of Work assigned him.

**Activities in the last fifteen years:** In these fifteen years, Aydamir continued to study the Soban art and he slowly became one of the elders of the cult, one of the most considered, at least. He created new alchemical reagents, one of which was deemed too dangerous for the formula to be shared with the Ministry of Work and it was kept hidden inside the secret library of the cult. While searching into the library, Aydamir found an old ancient text that could be the key to immortality, inside he found the script to achieve a perfect ageless body, and another script that was almost unreadable because it was written in an ancient language. During these years, Aydamir tried to translate the text and succeded, it was a script to create a more powerful Elixir that may grant true immortality. [Despite having the virtue and the flaw associated with the Initiation Script, Aydamir may postpone his self initation to better study Soban Alchemy and his other arts before starting to create the Great Elixir]

## New Formulae

**Fulminating Gold**  
Reagent Level 20  
Alteration: Major  
This process uses powdered gold and creates an explosive substance that, when in contact with fire, explodes dealing +15 damage to everything within 5 paces, while dealing +5 damage to everything between 5 and 10 paces, the damage may vary based on how much the targets are covered, using the table in ArM Core pp. 181. This reagent was found by Aydamir and his assistants when they were experimenting with ammonium salts and Aydamir decided to keep the formula a secret even to the Ministry of Work, it might be too dangerous to share it.  
*(Base 5, +3 Major)*

**Purified Haoma**  
Reagent Level 15  
Alteration: Substantial  
This process purifies up to 50 inches³ of Haoma in liquid form, granting it a +2 bonus to his Material bonuses (it will have a "+7 promotes longevity").  
*(Base 5, +2 Substantial)*

**Tincture of Ammonium and Valerian**  
Theriac Level 10  
Potency: Strong  
Similar to the *Cataplasme of Mandrake*, this theriac causes the character to become Dazed (loss of four Fatigue levels), but reduces any Wound and Disease Penalty by 5. The body part remains numb until the lost Fatigue levels are recovered. Aydamir commisioned this tincture to his personal Apothecary to be able to create powders even when injured, reducing the Wound Penalty to -1 or -2 makes him able to do the necessary Lab work (More doses are needed to be able to create powders for several hours).  
*(Base 3, +3 Strong)*

## Initiation Scripts

*Vulgar Alchemy*  
**Ease Factor:** 15  
**Script Bonus:** +10  
**Script Details:** The alchemist need to spend a season collecting powders and helping the Mystagogue in his laboratory (+1 Time), then he need to search for a Gem of Virtue usually protected by some jinn or magical creature (+3 Quest). He needs to grind the found gem into fine powder and then use expensive materials (+1 Goods) to experiment on a potion. The Mystagogue spends a Season to teach the alchemist more on the Soban Alchemist Lore and introduces the alchemist into the Soban Alchemist cult (+3 Mystagogue Time). The new member needs to swear a *Vow* to not share his knowledge with anyone outside the cult (+3 Minor Ordeal). [The benefit from Vulgar Alchemy may only be gained through Seasonal experimental activities.]

*Soban Philosophical Alchemy (Minor)*  
**Ease Factor:** 15 (-3 previous Ordeal)  
**Script Bonus:** +6 (+2 Sympathetic bonus)  
**Script Details:** During the summer solstice, the alchemist have to venture to Nabta Playa, a place in the Nubian desert where, thousand of years ago, the first magicians fashioned what may be among the earliest known archeoastronomical devices (+3 Place and Time) and the Soban alchemists think they are their descendants. Upon arrival, he needs to prepare a mobile laboratory in order to craft powders infused with the power of the stars where the main components are expensive grinded gems (+1 Goods), this ritual will grant him the *Soban Philosophical Alchemy* Virtue. [The alchemist have to arrive in the location prior to the summer solstice and find the suitable point to build the mobile laboratory (with a Int + Artes Liberales astronomy roll vs EF 9+) but when he brew the potions under the night sky, the power of the stars temporarily grants the Laboratory Total a +3 bonus to enhance magic and granting powers.]

*Lesser Elixir*  
**Ease Factor:** 15 (-3 previous Ordeal)  
**Script Bonus:** +5  
**Script Details:** The alchemist have to spend a season working for the cult by initiating younger alchemist into other virtues (+1 Time). In another season, the alchemist needs to brew a number of Potion of Longevity equal to his (Age / 10) rounded up and drink them all at once with an equal number of pawns of Vim vis (+1 Goods) to attune his body to receive a more powerful potion. The magical forces inside his body will inflict the *Monstrous Blood* Flaw on him (+3 Minor Ordeal) but he will gain the *Lesser Elixir* Virtue, he will also gain a number of Elixir Points equal to the number of potions he drank divided by 2 (rounded up). The Monstrous Blood inside him grants him a *Lesser Power* that triggers involuntarily (while angry, or in an heated situation, while sneezing, while yawning, ...) and sends a short shockwave around him, sometimes breaking some objects.  

*Unaging*  
**Ease Factor:** 18 (-3 previous Ordeal)  
**Script Bonus:** +9  
**Script Details:** The alchemist have to spend a season bathing in a large pool diluted with several pawns of Vim vis, at least (Age / 10) rounded up. This long bath will slowly enhance the magical structure inside the alchemist body granting him the *Unaging* Virtue but it will inflict the *Enfeebled* Flaw on him (+9 Major Ordeal). Aydamir found this initiation script, together with the script for *The Great Elixir*, in an ancient text hidden in the soban main library, partially written in Meroitic, he translated it with the help of a linguist and he decided to self initiate himself.

*The Great Elixir*  
**Ease Factor:** 30 (-9 previous Ordeal)  
**Script Bonus:** +13 (+1 Sympathetic bonus)  
**Script Details:** The alchemist have to do difficult astrological calculations on his nativity horoscope that take a whole Season to accomplish (this requires an Int + Artes Liberales astronomy roll vs EF 9+), while also calculating a specific place magically bounded to his body and uncovered by the vis flowing through his veins. He has to go to that specific place in that specific day and hour and perform the rest of the ritual (+3 Place and Time). Preparing an alchemical circle attuned to the flow lines of the vis in his body, he has to eat at least (Age / 10), rounded up, pawns of Vim vis, this process will again stir the powerful magical forces inside his body that will inflict the *Hunger for Vim Magic* Flaw on him (+9 Major Ordeal), while granting *The Great Elixir* Virtue because now he's finally attuned himself to the Vim form. Aydamir added the requirement of a specific place and time attuned to his body to be able to initiate himself, the original script only had the Major Ordeal.

## New Virtues

**Soban Philosophical Alchemy (Minor)**  
*Minor Supernatural Virtue*  
This virtue is similar to the hermetic *Philosophical Alchemy* Virtue. The alchemist uses his Succurro Magicam Lab Total to extract vis from Aura but he may add his score in Soban Alchemy when using automatic extraction of vis. He may also use this automatic process to brew batches of Sovereign Reagents and, in this yearly period, he can can make a maximum number of doses equal to twice his Profession: Apothecary Ability, however if they're making them using the city’s coin (e.g. by working for the Ministry of Work), they are typically required to use at least half of these doses discharging their duties.  

**Lesser Elixir**  
*Minor Supernatural Virtue*  
This virtue is similar to the hermetic *Lesser Elixir* Virtue. When the alchemist brews a potion that promotes longevity he may exceed the usual +10 limit to the Living Condition's modifier, but only for potions and when he creates such a potion, he may design one of the charges he created to be a Lesser Elixir by spending additional pawns of vis equal to (Age / 5), rounded up (this cost may not be paid with Sovereign Reagent). If the alchemists brews these potion through a Laboratory Text, the number of pawns of vis he can use is limited by Salutem and not Soban Alchemy. As per the hermetic virtue, the Lesser Elixir is brewed by adding special ingredients and the Elixir Level is determined by the Elixir Points, limited by Soban Alchemy score (as in TM:RE pp. 42). The Aging Bonus will be Living Condition's Modifier + Other Bonuses + Elixir Level and the Lesser Elixir remains active for a number of years equal to the alchemist's Soban Alchemy score or until the next Crisis, whichever comes first.

**The Great Elixir**  
*Minor Supernatural Virtue*  
This virtue is similar to the hermetic *The Great Elixir* Virtue. The alchemist may open a potion-like device as Hermetic Magi do, this will be the Great Elixir. The Lesser Elixir, that needs to be bound to the Great Elixir, uses up (Elixir of the Soban Alchemist Level / 5) enchantment space on the device. The alchemist also has to devise two special enchantments:

> **Become a Being  of Magic**  
TuSa(Ma) 50  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Always On, **T**: Ind, Mystery Effect  
**Pen:** 0, costant effect  
If the Great Elixir works, the magus transforms into a being aligned to the Magic realm, making him a magical creature. This enchantment is instilled into the potion, so the alchemist gains the bonus for enchanting a potion and he may use Material and Shape bonuses as usual.  
*(Unique Mystery)*

> **Grant Might**  
SuMa Gen  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Always On, **T**: Ind, Mystery Effect  
**Pen:** 0, costant effect  
If the Great Elixir works, the magus gains Magic Might equal to half (effect level–20). This enchantment is instilled into the potion, so the alchemist gains the bonus for enchanting a potion and he may use Material and Shape bonuses as usual.  
*(Unique Mystery)*

The other rules for *The Great Elixir* are the same.
