**Appearance:** Aydamir is young dark-skinned man who usually wears the traditional Soban alchemists clothes. Many people find his gaze a little disturbing but he doesn't care that much, even though he usually spends his time in the laboratory the Ministry of Work assigned him.

**Activities in the last fifteen years:** In these fifteen years, Aydamir perfected his skills and arts, he created new alchemical reagents like the *Water-purifying stone* and the *Alchemical Mercury* while finally finishing the *Greek Fire* brew. He also created a potion to promote longevity but quickly abandoned the project because it was too much expensive, it costed him 8 doses of Sovereign Reagent to craft it, and it lasted only for 1 year. He thought that, maybe, a more powerful powder could do the same and he enhanced the previously created powder to achieve similar goals. Aydamir was taught a particular way to refine the Sovereign Reagents and also to extract pawns of vis from the aura from his old master Tapara, a new, very useful way that released him from seasons of useless work. The Ministry of Work asked him to create something to aid the injured people, given that many alchemist are sometimes subjected to *explosive* situations and Aydamir also had to create a pastille in anticipation of a possible war with the near cities, in return the Ministry of Work assigned 2 assistants to Aydamir, so that he can work faster and more easily. In these fifteen years, Aydamir gained another 180 Labor Points and reached a total of 330 Labor Points, 30 more and he'll be Wealthy.

**Ease Factor:** 15  
**Script Bonus:** +10  
**Script Details:** The alchemist need to spend a season collecting powders and helping the Mystagogue in his laboratory (+1 Time), then he need to search for a Gem of Virtue usually protected by some jinn or magical creature (+3 Quest). He needs to grind the found gem into fine powder and then use expensive materials (+1 Goods) to experiment on a potion. The Mystagogue spends a Season to teach the alchemist more on the Soban Alchemist Lore and introduces the alchemist into the Soban Alchemist cult (+3 Mystagogue Time). The new member needs to swear a *Vow* to not share his knowledge with anyone outside the cult (+3 Minor Ordeal). [The benefit from Vulgar Alchemy may only be gained through Seasonal experimental activities.]

*Soban Philosophical Alchemy (Minor)*  
**Ease Factor:** 15 (-3 previous Ordeal)  
**Script Bonus:** +6 (+2 Sympathetic bonus)  
**Script Details:** During the summer solstice, the alchemist have to venture to Nabta Playa, a place in the Nubian desert where, thousand of years ago, the first magicians fashioned what may be among the earliest known archeoastronomical devices (+3 Place and Time) and the Soban alchemists think they are their descendants. Upon arrival, he needs to prepare a mobile laboratory in order to craft powders infused with the power of the stars where the main components are expensive grinded gems (+1 Goods), this ritual will grant him the *Soban Philosophical Alchemy* Virtue. [The alchemist have to arrive in the location prior to the summer solstice and find the suitable point to build the mobile laboratory (with a Int + Artes Liberales astronomy roll vs EF 9+) but when he brew the potions under the night sky, the power of the stars temporarily grants the Laboratory Total a +3 bonus to enhance magic and granting powers.]

## New Virtues

**Soban Philosophical Alchemy (Minor)**  
*Minor Supernatural Virtue*  
This virtue is similar to the hermetic *Philosophical Alchemy* Virtue. The alchemist uses his Succurro Magicam Lab Total to extract vis from Aura but he may add his score in Soban Alchemy when using automatic extraction of vis. He may also use this automatic process to brew batches of Sovereign Reagents and, in this yearly period, he can can make a maximum number of doses equal to twice his Profession: Apothecary Ability, however if they're making them using the city’s coin (e.g. by working for the Ministry of Work), they are typically required to use at least half of these doses discharging their duties. The alchemist may not experiment using this automatic process.
