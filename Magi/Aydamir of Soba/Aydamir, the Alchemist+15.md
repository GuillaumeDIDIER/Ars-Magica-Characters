**Appearance:** Aydamir is young dark-skinned man who usually wears the traditional Soban alchemists clothes. Many people find his gaze a little disturbing but he doesn't care that much, even though he usually spends his time in the laboratory the Ministry of Work assigned him.

**Activities in the last fifteen years:** In these fifteen years, Aydamir worked very hard for the Ministry of Work to show his loyalty and to partially repay his debt. He created numerous batches of Sovereign Reagents (creating 12 doses in a Season) and he created famous alchemical reagents from laboratory texts of other Soban alchemists. He obtained the formula of *Greek Fire* from an ancient greek text that he bought from a merchant and he started to craft the reagent but it's very difficult so he only has 8 points towards his project. He also started to meddle with theriacs and inceptions, beginning with simple things. He developped a handful of powders to help him in doing his job as an alchemist but, for now, he refrain to create potions because they're very expensive and he doesn't have that much Sovereign Reagent stored. He lastly joined the Soban Alchemist cult and, after swearing a vow, he was taught a new way of experimenting with powders and alchemical components. In these fifteen years, Aydamir gained 150 Labor Points with his profession, he intends to become Wealthy to have more time for his experiments.

## Aydamir's Laboratory

His laboratory was built under contract with the Minister of Labor but under his supervision. Aydamir asked for an alchemial still to be included for the production of Sovereign Reagent to be more effective, and the thick walls and well-constructed building made the facility safer from accidents caused by the various experiments.
