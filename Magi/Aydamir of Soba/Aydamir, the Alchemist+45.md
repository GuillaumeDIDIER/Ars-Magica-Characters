**Appearance:** Aydamir is young dark-skinned man who usually wears the traditional Soban alchemists clothes. Many people find his gaze a little disturbing but he doesn't care that much, even though he usually spends his time in the laboratory the Ministry of Work assigned him.

**Activities in the last fifteen years:** In the first three years, Aydamir raised enough money to become Wealthy and, from that moment, he focused on his experiments. In the following years, he devised new powders and potions to help him and his colleagues in various experiments and he also created new war-focused alchemical substances for the Ministry of Work. He gained ranks in the cult thanks to his reputation, reaching almost the top, and so he was asked to join the Council of the Alchemists, the heads of the cult. One of the elders, Kosma, teaught Aydamir the knowldege necessary to create an elixir and, as many other before him, Aydamir started to become a new being, a Magical being.

**Pen:** 0, 1 charge  
This powder, crafted when needed, grants a +3 bonus to rolls for the Magic Lore Ability. Aydamir uses this powder to gain insight when using Vulgar Alchemy to experiment on alchemical components. This powder isn't useful for longer projects like potions, Aydamir needs to make a Season Duration powder to affect him long enough.   
*(Base 10, +1 Sun)*

**Pastille of Combat Enhancement**  
SuFa 25  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Sun, **T**: Group  
**Pen:** 0, 1 charge  
This pastille grants a +3 bonus to all rolls for the Single Weapon Ability. The Ministry of Work requested this pastille to be produced when they feared that the war between two factions in a near city might spread to Soba itself. This pastille costs 5 doses of Sovereign Reagent or 5 pawns of vis to produce. Similar pastilles exist that grant the *Berserk* Virtue or the *Reserve of Strength* Virtue.  
*(Base 10, +1 Sun, +2 Group)*

SuMa 15  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Sun, **T**: Ind  
**Pen:** 0, 1 charge  
This powder, crafted when needed, grants the *Minor Potent Magic* Virtue. Aydamir usually chooses to use this powder to boost one aspect of his Soban Alchemy and uses a phial of purified mercury to further enhance it. Sometimes he chooses to use this powder to enhance his creativity and geniusness in creating other powders, this grants him a +3 bonus to his Lab Total related to the chosen Minor Potent Magic, usually longevity. Similar powders may grant *Minor Magical Focus* or *Puissant Art*.  
*(Base 10, +1 Sun)*

SuMa 15  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Sun, **T**: Ind

SuMa 25  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Season, **T**: Ind  
**Pen:** 0, 1 charge  
This potion grants the target the *Unaffected by the Gift* Virtue. Aydamir and other alchemists developped this potion to help them in working together when the penalties of the Gift were getting in the way of their work. This potion costs at least 5 doses of Sovereign Reagent or 5 pawns of vis but it's usually produced in a batch because additional doses only cost 1 additional pawn (or Sovereign Reagent dose).  
*(Base 10, +3 Season)*

**Potion of Magical Empowerment**  
SuMa 35  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Season, **T**: Ind  
**Pen:** 0, 1 charge  
This potion grants the target the *Major Potent Magic* Virtue. Aydamir developped this potion to help him in brewing the Elixir and other very difficult potions or powders.

This potion costs at least 7 doses of Sovereign Reagent or 7 pawns of vis.    
*(Base 20, +3 Season)*

### Tueor Salutem

SuSa 15  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Month, **T**: Ind  
**Pen:** 0, 1 charge  
This powder grants a +10 bonus to Soak Total against damage caused by a laboratory explosion. Soban Alchemists usually experiment in laboratory to achieve greater heights and reach the pinnacle of alchemy but this is dangerous and they need a *safety net* in case something goes wrong.

SuSa 20  
**R**: Touch, **D**: Season, **T**: Ind  
**Pen:** 0, 1 charge

He thought that powders, enhanced by a cinnabar-based concotion, may have the same effect now that he's better at Salutem.

**Rejuvenating Powder of Longevity**

*(Base 3, +2 Month)*

**Elixir of the Soban Alchemist**

*(Minimum Lab Total: 46, Effect: Base 15, +3 Season)*

## Initiation Scripts

*Vulgar Alchemy*  
**Ease Factor:** 15  
**Script Bonus:** +10  
**Script Details:** The alchemist need to spend a season collecting powders and helping the Mystagogue in his laboratory (+1 Time), then he need to search for a Gem of Virtue usually protected by some jinn or magical creature (+3 Quest). He needs to grind the found gem into fine powder and then use expensive materials (+1 Goods) to experiment on a potion. The Mystagogue spends a Season to teach the alchemist more on the Soban Alchemist Lore and introduces the alchemist into the Soban Alchemist cult (+3 Mystagogue Time). The new member needs to swear a *Vow* to not share his knowledge with anyone outside the cult (+3 Minor Ordeal). [The benefit from Vulgar Alchemy may only be gained through Seasonal experimental activities.]

*Soban Philosophical Alchemy (Minor)*  
**Ease Factor:** 15 (-3 previous Ordeal)  
**Script Bonus:** +6 (+2 Sympathetic bonus)  
**Script Details:** During the summer solstice, the alchemist have to venture to Nabta Playa, a place in the Nubian desert where, thousand of years ago, the first magicians fashioned what may be among the earliest known archeoastronomical devices (+3 Place and Time) and the Soban alchemists think they are their descendants. Upon arrival, he needs to prepare a mobile laboratory in order to craft powders infused with the power of the stars where the main components are expensive grinded gems (+1 Goods), this ritual will grant him the *Soban Philosophical Alchemy* Virtue. [The alchemist have to arrive in the location prior to the summer solstice and find the suitable point to build the mobile laboratory (with a Int + Artes Liberales astronomy roll vs EF 9+) but when he brew the potions under the night sky, the power of the stars temporarily grants the Laboratory Total a +3 bonus to enhance magic and granting powers.]

*Lesser Elixir*  
**Ease Factor:** 15 (-3 previous Ordeal)  
**Script Bonus:** +5  
**Script Details:** The alchemist have to spend a season working for the cult by initiating younger alchemists into other virtues (+1 Time). In another season, the alchemist needs to brew a number of Potion of Longevity equal to his (Age / 10) rounded up and drink them all at once with an equal number of pawns of Vim vis (+1 Goods) to attune his body to receive a more powerful potion. The magical forces inside his body will inflict the *Monstrous Blood* Flaw on him (+3 Minor Ordeal) but he will gain the *Lesser Elixir* Virtue, he will also gain a number of Elixir Points equal to the number of potions he drank divided by 2 (rounded up). The Monstrous Blood inside him grants him a *Lesser Power* that triggers involuntarily (while angry, or in an heated situation, while sneezing, while yawning, ...) and sends a short shockwave around him, sometimes breaking some objects.  

## New Virtues

**Soban Philosophical Alchemy (Minor)**  
*Minor Supernatural Virtue*  
This virtue is similar to the hermetic *Philosophical Alchemy* Virtue. The alchemist uses his Succurro Magicam Lab Total to extract vis from Aura but he may add his score in Soban Alchemy when using automatic extraction of vis. He may also use this automatic process to brew batches of Sovereign Reagents and, in this yearly period, he can can make a maximum number of doses equal to twice his Profession: Apothecary Ability, however if they're making them using the city’s coin (e.g. by working for the Ministry of Work), they are typically required to use at least half of these doses discharging their duties.  

**Lesser Elixir**  
*Minor Supernatural Virtue*  
This virtue is similar to the hermetic *Lesser Elixir* Virtue. When the alchemist brews a potion that promotes longevity he may exceed the usual +10 limit to the Living Condition's modifier, but only for potions and when he creates such a potion, he may design one of the charges he created to be a Lesser Elixir by spending additional pawns of vis equal to (Age / 5), rounded up (this cost may not be paid with Sovereign Reagent). If the alchemist brews these potion through a Laboratory Text, the number of pawns of vis he can use is limited by Salutem and not Soban Alchemy. As per the hermetic virtue, the Lesser Elixir is brewed by adding special ingredients and the Elixir Level is determined by the Elixir Points, limited by Soban Alchemy score (as in TM:RE pp. 42). The Aging Bonus will be Living Condition's Modifier + Other Bonuses + Elixir Level and the Lesser Elixir remains active for a number of years equal to the alchemist's Soban Alchemy score or until the next Crisis, whichever comes first.
