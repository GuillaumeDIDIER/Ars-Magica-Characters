This repo is meant to be a nice place to share many ars magica character sheets.

Organisation will have Magi / Companions / Grogs as folders, in which chacracter may be a single file or a folder (dependeing of the amount of data).

Lining to a spreadsheet / online source is possible, but it is nice to have in addition to this, a copy of the info in the usual "compressed" format used by Ars Magica books.

Pull requests are encouraged (you can also ping me on the Ars Magica discord as @Sobex).
